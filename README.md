## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Using Figma

### What I learned

I took advantage of this project to practice the use of variables in CSS, which standardize and facilitate project maintenance.

A code snippet below:

```css
:root {
  --green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --blue: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);

  --grey-700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  --grey-800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  --grey-900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);

  --inter: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve the use of **Flexbox** and further improve the dynamics of using **Figma**
